LeapDrop is a (Leap Motion + Chrome Extension + Android) hack that allows the geek to drag a webpage from one computer and drop it to another computer, where it opens ~~almost~~ instantly.

LeapDrop was developed at InOut 3.0 Hackathon, organized at SVNIT Surat on 13th and 14th August, 2016.

LeapDrop is developed by [Umang Galaiya](http://umanggalaiya.in/), [Siddharth Goswami](http://siddharth.xyz/), and [Soham Dodia](http://sohamdodia.tk)
